1. Go to **Settings → Billing**
2. Click **Cancel Subscription**
3. Choose whether to downgrade immediately or at the end of your billing period
4. Confirm

If you have more medications or labs than the new plan allows, you'll need to archive some before downgrading.

**On iPhone (Safari)**:
1. Open TrackMe+ in Safari

- Reports
- Settings
- Logout

Tap any item to open that screen.

### Using the Camera for OCR

Mobile makes OCR scanning easy because you can use your phone's camera.

**To Scan a Lab Report**:
1. Go to Labs
2. Tap **📷 Scan**
3. Your camera opens
4. Point it at your lab report and tap the shutter button
5. Wait while it processes
6. Review and import the data

**To Scan a Receipt**:
1. Go to More → Budget

Make sure the image is clear and well-lit for best results.

### Offline Mode

If you lose internet connection, you can still:

- See your Today screen
- Read dose history

You can't:
- Add new doses (they'll save when you reconnect)
- Sync with the desktop version
- Use OCR features
- Load new data

When you reconnect, everything syncs automatically.

## Troubleshooting

### Can't Log In / Forgot Password

**If you forgot your password**:
1. Click **Forgot Password?** on the login page
2. Enter your email
3. Click **Send Reset Link**
4. Check your email (including spam folder)
5. Click the reset link
6. Enter a new password

**If the reset email doesn't arrive**:
- Wait 5-10 minutes (sometimes emails are slow)
- Check your spam/junk folder
- Make sure you entered the right email address
- Try requesting a new reset link

**If you still can't log in**, contact support via the Support tab in Settings.

### Doses Not Showing on Schedule

**Check these things**:

1. **Is the medication set to Active?**
   - Go to My Medications
   - Make sure it says "Active" not "Inactive" or "Archived"

2. **Is the frequency set correctly?**
   - Open the medication
   - Check the frequency (Daily, Twice Daily, etc.)
   - Make sure the time(s) of day are set

3. **Are you looking at the right date?**
   - The date picker at the top of Today shows which day you're viewing
   - Click it to make sure you're on today

4. **Did you start the medication recently?**
   - Doses only show from the start date forward
   - Check the Start Date in the medication details

If none of that helps, try refreshing the page (Ctrl+R on desktop, pull down to refresh on mobile).

### OCR Scan Not Working

**For lab scans**:
- Make sure the image is clear and well-lit
- Try to get the whole table of results in the photo
- Don't crop too tightly—leave some margin
- If it still doesn't work, you might need to enter the data manually

**For receipt scans**:
- Make sure the vendor name, date, and prices are visible
- Flatten the receipt so there are no shadows or creases
- Try taking the photo from directly above

**If you keep getting errors**:
- Check that you have OCR scans remaining (Premium feature)
- Try a different image
- Contact support if the problem persists

### Data Not Syncing Between Desktop and Mobile

Data syncs automatically when you use the app. If you're not seeing changes:

1. **Refresh the page**:
   - Desktop: Press Ctrl+R (Windows) or Cmd+R (Mac)
   - Mobile: Pull down from the top to refresh

2. **Make sure you're logged into the same account**:
   - Check the email shown in Settings → Profile on both devices
   - If they're different, log out and log in with the right account

3. **Check your internet connection**:
   - Mobile: Make sure you're not in offline mode
   - Try opening a website to confirm you're connected

4. **Wait a minute and try again**:
   - Sometimes there's a short delay

If data still doesn't sync after a few minutes, log out and log back in.

### How to Clear Cache / Force Refresh

If the app looks wrong or old data is showing:

**Desktop**:
- Windows: Press Ctrl+Shift+R
- Mac: Press Cmd+Shift+R

This forces a full reload.

**Mobile**:
- Pull down from the top of the screen to refresh
- If that doesn't work, close the app completely (swipe it away from recent apps) and reopen it

**Nuclear option** (if nothing else works):
1. Log out
2. Clear your browser cache (in browser settings)
3. Close the browser completely
4. Reopen and log back in

### How to Report a Bug or Request a Feature

1. Go to **Settings → Support**
2. Click **Report an Issue**
3. Choose **Bug** or **Feature Request**
4. Describe the problem or idea
5. Add a screenshot if it helps
6. Click **Submit**

The team reads all reports and will follow up via email.

## Tips & Best Practices

### Setting Up Your First Medication Protocol

1. **Start with one medication**
   Add your first medication and get comfortable logging doses for a few days before adding more.

2. **Set realistic times**
   Pick times you'll actually remember. If you always have coffee at 8 AM, schedule your morning dose for 8 AM.

3. **Use the Today screen daily**
   Check it every morning to see what you need to take. Check off doses as you go.

4. **Enable notifications**
   Go to Settings → Notifications and turn on Dose Reminders. You'll get a reminder when it's time.

### Managing a TRT Regimen

**TRT = Testosterone Replacement Therapy**

Typical setup:
- Medication: Testosterone Cypionate 200mg/ml
- Dose: 100mg (0.5ml)
- Frequency: Twice weekly (Monday and Thursday)
- Injection sites: Rotating (thigh, glute, abdomen)

**Tips**:
- Log your injection site each time so you can rotate properly
- Track labs (Testosterone Total, Free Testosterone, Estradiol, etc.) every 3 months
- Use Lab Trends to see how your levels respond to dose changes
- Link syringes and needles as supplies so you know when to reorder

### Tracking Peptide Cycles with Titration

**Titration = gradually increasing the dose**

Example: Semaglutide for weight loss
- Week 1-4: 0.25mg
- Week 5-8: 0.5mg
- Week 9-12: 1mg
- Then 4 weeks off (washout)

**How to track this**:

1. **Option 1: One medication, edit the dose as you increase**
   - Add Semaglutide at 0.25mg
   - After 4 weeks, edit it to 0.5mg
   - After 4 more weeks, edit it to 1mg
   - Track the cycle to know when to stop

2. **Option 2: Variants for each dose level**
   - Add "Semaglutide 0.25mg"
   - After 4 weeks, add "Semaglutide 0.5mg" (archive the 0.25mg)
   - After 4 more weeks, add "Semaglutide 1mg" (archive the 0.5mg)
   - Keeps history of each phase

**Use Cycle Tracking (Premium)**: Set your medication as a cycle with on/off periods, and the app will automatically count days and show you when to take a break.

### Using Receipt Scanning to Track Spending

If you buy medications and supplies regularly:

1. **Keep all receipts**
   Even digital ones from email.

2. **Scan them as soon as you get them**
   Open TrackMe+, go to Purchases, and scan the receipt while it's fresh.

3. **Let the AI do the work**
   It extracts the vendor, date, and prices. You just review and confirm.

4. **Review your Budget Analytics monthly**
   See which vendors are cheapest, which medications cost the most, and track your monthly spending.

5. **Check Days Remaining on medication cards**
   Each medication card shows how many days of supply you have left, so you know when to reorder.

### Getting the Most Out of Reports for Doctor Visits

Before your appointment:

1. **Generate a Doctor Printout**
   Go to Reports → Doctor Printout → Generate.

2. **Add any notes**
   If there's anything specific you want to discuss, add it to a medication's Notes field before generating the report.

3. **Include recent labs**
   If you had labs done recently, make sure they're in the system. They'll show on the report.

4. **Print or save as PDF**
   Bring a printed copy or have the PDF on your phone to show the doctor.

5. **Use Lab Trends to visualize changes**
   If you're discussing whether a dose change is working, show the Lab Trends graph. It's easier to see than a table of numbers.

**Doctors love this** because it's organized and complete. Much better than trying to remember everything off the top of your head.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can I use TrackMe+ offline?**
A: On mobile, you can view data that's already loaded, but you need internet to sync or add new data.

**Q: Is my data private?**
A: Yes. Your data is encrypted and only you can access it. We never share it with third parties. See the Privacy Policy for details.

**Q: Can I export my data?**
A: Yes! Go to Settings → Data and click **Export All Data**. You'll get a ZIP file with CSV spreadsheets of everything.

**Q: What if I switch from vials to a pen?**
A: Edit the medication and change the Type from "Vial" to "Pen". Update the dose amount if needed. Your history stays intact.

**Q: Can I track medications for my kids?**
A: Yes, with a Premium subscription. Add them as dependents in Settings → Family. You'll manage their medications and doses.

**Q: What's the difference between Archive and Delete?**
A: Archive keeps the medication and all its dose history, but hides it from your active list. Delete removes it completely, including all doses. Archive is safer.

**Q: Why does my dose unit say "units" instead of "ml"?**
A: For medications that have a concentration (mg/ml), TrackMe+ converts to insulin syringe units. You can change it back by editing the medication.

**Q: How accurate is the OCR scanning?**
A: Pretty good, but not perfect. Always review the extracted data before importing. Fix any mistakes.

**Q: Can I share my account with my spouse?**
A: You can both log in with the same credentials, but you'll see the same data. If you want separate tracking, create two accounts and add each other as family members (Premium).

**Q: I hit my lab limit. What now?**
A: You can upgrade to a higher tier (Standard has 50/year, Premium has unlimited), or wait until the year resets. The year is based on when you created your account, not the calendar year.

**Q: Can I change my subscription from monthly to yearly?**
A: Not yet, but it's on the roadmap. Monthly is the only option for now.

**Q: What happens if I cancel my subscription?**
A: You keep access until the end of your billing period. Then you drop to the Free plan. If you have more than 3 medications, you'll need to archive some. Your data isn't deleted—you just can't edit it until you resubscribe.

**Q: Can I get a refund?**
A: Subscriptions are non-refundable, but you can cancel anytime to stop future charges.
